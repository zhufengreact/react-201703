###single responsibility principle
One component  should idealy do only one thing

###Use props to build static component(with no interactive)
State is reserved only for interactive, that is,data that changes over time.


##Hieracchy: top to bottom
##Test/Unit test bottom to up

##React's one way data flow(also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast.
If you make a change to your underlying data model and call ReactDOM.render() again.

###decouple 解耦


###State vs props
1. It is passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probaly is't state.
2. Dose it remain overtime? If so, it probaly is't state.
3. Can you compute it based on other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't a state.
